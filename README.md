# Bellman Meets Hawkes:  Model-Based Reinforcement Learning via Temporal Point Processes

The repo for Bellman Meets Hawkes: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning via Temporal Point Processes

This is the demonstration of 8 events synthetic simulation in the paper.

## Quick Start
1. To run the model, simply run the main file:
```
python main.py
```
2. The config file can be found in:
```
configs/config.yaml
```
3. The simulation is implemented by:
```
env_hawkes_event.py
```
